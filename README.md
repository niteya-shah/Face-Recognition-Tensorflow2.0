# Face-Recognition-Tensorflow2.0
Face Recognition in Tensorflow 2.0 using a Deep Neural network based on Online mining with Siamese Triplet Loss

## what is currently present
The following code allows you to train from scratch a deep neural network for face recognition. The Model currently provides:
1. Pre-Process a Dataset
2. Mining for images using 
  - Online mining
  - Offline mining
3. Setting a Model Architecture
  - Mobile Net V2
  - Resnet
  - A custom Model
 4. Train the model
